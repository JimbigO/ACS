# ACS
Aquarium Control System, Arduino controlled
Code created by Craig Sellwood 20-09-2017
Modified by James Cooper to add further features including intergration with Rasberry Pi

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ACS is designed to automate the dosing of liquid CO2 into an aquarium. this is achieved using an Arduino Uno and a 6v DC peristaltic pump controlled via a Relay board. The arduino uses a real time clock (RTC) to retain an accurate time of day this allows the dosing to be scheduled during the day.

Requirements 
- Accurate dosing of Liquid CO2 or any liquid plant food
- Scheduled dosing Day / Weekly / Monthly
- adjustable control of the amount of dose via control of the pump.
